# TODO

- See nerdcommenter for ideas on how to support many languages
  without a bunch of ftplugin files.
- Integrate with coc.nvim to get current linter, and the error code.
  Thereby get the disabling label automatically.
- Add functionality to permanently add code as a rule to linter
  in the proj config.
